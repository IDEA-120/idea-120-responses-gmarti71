When I read the article from Salter, the word Gesamtkunstwerk stood out to me. It means "the total work of art," and was introduced by German composer by the name 
of Richard Wagner. He had a belief that the term should included the blueprints and process of a piece. In the article he discusses about different art works 
including artchiecture. An example that I found similar to the gesamtkunstwerk theory can be viewed in the Rhizome Anthology called "Starry Night." It is a interface 
of email discussions about artist's art work. The dots on the page are messages or responses for each other's work. The texts were saved and created to be a called a 
textbase. The more respones came and it increased the brightness of messages of that art piece which creates this idea of a constellation.
