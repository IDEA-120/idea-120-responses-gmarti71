Very cool work on this poetry project! Using these short phrases, "I am here" and "Could of been over there", you shape a world where 'physical' space takes 
shape through these url links to images/gifs. I often think about the nature of identity online, but I can't say I've thought about the actual 
physical being, presented online. Also, I enjoyed that the narrator refers to themselves (I) and to either the reader or someone else (you) for the whole 
poem up until the introduction of "he" at the very end. Made me go back for a second readthrough with that context. Excellent job!
