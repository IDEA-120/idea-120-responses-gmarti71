In Murray's reading, I belived her predictions on internet televison and virtual enviroments like VR were extremely successful. The internet is used widely for many
different things and one of those things is entertainment. Streaming services like Netflix, Paramount, or Hulu are letting their audience gain entertainment through 
shows with virtual environments that they wouldn't be able to see in real life. Shows like Supernatural, Marvel movies, or even the Mandalorian give off these 
intereting special effects that has everyone playing attention to the screen more then anything else. It captivates them and kinda looks like they were put
in a trance.
