The image that I chose for this response is this:

The image contains two people with to different life styles saying "I wish I had more money." One of the men seems to be in distress and NEEDS more money. The 
other person seem to be dressed formally and probably has a better life compared to other person and seems to WANT more money. The difference between both is the 
WANT and NEED of money.
