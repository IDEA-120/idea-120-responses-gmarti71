When reading the article of Birdie, I strongly related to his point. We all know the interent is vast and honestly consider infinite. Since its vast its very
difficult to even impossible to control whats being put out there with restrictions. The examples shown in the article like Peppa Pig and the finger family is 
something I have caught my little brother watching from time to time. I as a sister want my brother to be safe and happy when being allowed to use his tablet. I will 
not tolerate the content that my brother finds on youtube without my supervision. The fact that I see kids around by brother's age watching these types of videos
really causes me to be concerned as well as the parent for not taking action and allowing this to happen. Birdie brings up a idea to elimate these harmful generated
content which I for one agree entirely. We can find a way where there can a restriction to these types of videos and have a service where a program of coding can 
distingish those types of content to be removed. Although this can work, there are possibillities that there can be videos that can bypass this. All we can do is to try
our hardest to remove as best as we can and supervise when we can.
