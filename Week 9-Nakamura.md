After reading Nakamura's citation, Lev saying "The interent and the World Wide are no longer places for pioneers to
explore and stake their claims; they have been absorbed into the texture of everyday life. 
I though the people who use the interent as a source of entertainment has made them kinda reliant on other people's work.

The interent is used for more then then just entertainment, but it is. Social media has impacted the world in many levels
by the developers giving us the freedom to express ourselves to others. 

A example of this is Tiktok. Its used for knowledge, entertainment, advice, etc. I think the developer of this app had in 
mind where he combines aspects like Snapchats 10-30 second video capture and instagram's posted format to create a bigger and 
better layout where its easier for people to use and be creative. I also believe the developer wanted other people to  
give him content to watch rather then him making his on videos. It kinda shows the differences in people who can share their beliefs,
lives, look, etc. To the people who generally would rather watch someone getting scared of a video game they wanted to play for example.

I personally use Tiktok as a way to pass the time, and I fall in the category of a (Viewer) and not a (Content Creator).
