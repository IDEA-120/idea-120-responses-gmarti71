This project is a mixture of the flarf poem and twine story.

Catch you

I  left to meet you 
I know that you knew
Ended in a place that I didn't have no clue

One thing for sure is there was a way out
I'm going to take the obvious route
For one thing I know I will not go without

To catch you

I hear my name many times
Yet I hear my name of all kinds
I tend to ignore them sometimes
All I had on my mind is

to snatch you

I run and feel steps behind me
I didn't want to know who it would be
The voice calling my name was the key
For he would be the one to set me free

He caught you.
